                <h1>Publisher Terms & Conditions</h1>

                <p>This Affiliate Program Operating Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between MGine Digtial LLC ("MGine Digital LLC " or "we"), and you, ("you" or "Affiliate") the party submitting an application to become a MGine Digital LLC affiliate). The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement apply to your participation with ("<a href="https://mgine.offerslook.com" target="_blank">Affiliate Program</a>"). Each Affiliate Program offer (an "Offer") may be for any offering by MGine Digital LLC or a third party (each such third party a "Client") and may link to a specific web site for that particular Offer ("Program Web Site"). Furthermore, each Offer may have additional terms and conditions on pages within the Affiliate Program and are incorporated as part of this Agreement. By submitting an application or participating in an Offer, you expressly consent to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sign up as an Affiliate</strong>
                        <p>You must submit an Affiliate Program application from our website. You must accurately complete the application to become an affiliate (and provide us with future updates) and not use any aliases or other means to mask your true identity or contact information. After we review your application, we will notify you of your acceptance or rejection to the Affiliate Program, generally within two (2) business days. We may accept or reject your application at our sole discretion for any reason.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Obligations of both Parties</strong>
                        <p>Subject to our acceptance of you as an affiliate and your continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, MGine Digital LLC agrees as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We will make available to you via the Affiliate Program graphic and textual links to the Program Web Site and/or other creative materials (collectively, the "Links") which you may display on web sites owned or controlled by you, in emails sent by you and clearly identified as coming from you and in online advertisements (collectively, "Media"). The Links will serve to identify you as a member of our Affiliate Program and will establish a link from your Media to the Program Web Site.</li>
                            <li>We will pay Affiliate for each Qualified Action (the "Commission"). A "Qualified Action" means an individual person who (i) accesses the Program Web Site via the Link, where the Link is the last link to the Program Web Site, (ii) is not a computer generated user, such as a robot, spider, computer script or other automated, artificial or fraudulent method to appear like an individual, real live person, (iii) is not using pre-populated fields (iv) completes all of the information required for such action within the time period allowed by MGine Digital LLC and (v) is not later determined by MGine Digital LLC to be fraudulent, incomplete, unqualified or a duplicate.</li>
                            <li>We will pay you any Commissions earned monthly, provided that your account is currently greater than $50. Accounts with a balance of less than $50 will roll over to the next month, and will continue to roll over monthly until $50 is reached. We reserve the right to charge back to your account any previously paid Qualified Actions that are later determined to have not met the requirements to be a Qualified Action.</li>
                            <li>Payment for Commissions is dependent upon Clients providing such funds to MGine Digital LLC, and therefore, you agree that MGine Digital LLC shall only be liable to you for Commissions to the extent that MGine Digital LLC has received such funds from the Clients. You hereby release MGine Digital LLC from any claim for Commissions if MGine Digital LLC has not received such funds from the Clients.</li>
                            <li>MGine Digital LLC shall automatically generate an invoice on behalf of Affiliate for all Commissions payable under this Agreement and shall remit payment to Affiliate based upon that invoice. All tracking of Links and determinations of Qualified Actions and Commissions shall be made by MGine Digital LLC in its sole discretion. In the event that Affiliate disputes in good faith any portion of an invoice, Affiliate must submit that dispute to MGine Digital LLC in writing and in sufficient detail within thirty (30) days of the date on the invoice. If Affiliate does not dispute the invoice as set forth herein, then Affiliate agrees that it irrevocably waives any claims based upon that invoice. In the event that Affiliate is also tracking Qualified Actions and Affiliate claims a discrepancy, Affiliate must provide MGine Digital LLC with Affiliate's reports within three (3) days after 30th day of the calendar month, and if MGine Digital LLC and Affiliate's reported statistics vary by more than 10% and MGine Digital LLC reasonably determines that Affiliate has used generally accepted industry methods to track Qualified Actions, then MGine Digital LLC and Affiliate agree to make a good faith effort to arrive at a reconciliation. If the parties are unable to arrive at a reconciliation, then MGine Digital LLC numbers shall govern.</li>
                            <li>If Affiliate has an outstanding balance due to MGine Digital LLC under this Agreement or any other agreement between the Affiliate and MGine Digital LLC, whether or not related to the Affiliate Program, Affiliate agrees that MGine Digital LLC may offset any such amounts due to MGine Digital LLC from amounts payable to Affiliate under this Agreement.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Affiliate also agrees to:</p>

                            <li>Make sure to not place MGine Digital LLC ads on any online auction platform (i.e. eBay, Amazon, Taobao, etc).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The following additional program-specific terms shall apply to any promotional programs set forth below:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Email Campaigns. For all email campaigns, Affiliate must download the "Suppression List" from the Offers section of MGine Digital LLC. Affiliate shall filter its email list by removing any entries appearing on the Suppression List and will only send emails to the remaining addresses on its email list. MGine Digital LLC will provide an opt-out method in all Links, however, if any opt-out requests come directly to Affiliate, Affiliate shall immediately forward them to MGine Digital LLC at contact@mgine.net. Affiliate's emails containing the Links may not include any content other than the Links, except as required by applicable law.</li>
                            <li>Affiliate agrees that failure to download the Suppression List and remove all emails from the database before mailing may result in Commission withholdings, removal or suspension from all or part of the Affiliate Program, possible legal action and any other rights or remedies available to MGine Digital LLC pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. Affiliate further agrees that it will not mail or market to any suppression files generated through the MGine Digital LLC network, and that doing so may result in Commission withholdings, removal or suspension from the Affiliate Program, possible legal action and any other rights or remedies available to MGine Digital LLC pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.</li>
                            <li>Advertising Campaigns. No Links can appear to be associated with or be positioned on chat rooms or bulletin boards unless otherwise agreed by MGine Digital LLC in writing. Any pop-ups/unders used for the Affiliate Program shall be clearly identified as Affiliate served in the title bar of the window and any client-side ad serving software used by Affiliate shall only have been installed on an end-user's computer if the function of the software is clearly disclosed to end-users prior to installation, the installation is pursuant to an affirmatively accepted and plain-english end user license agreement and the software be easily removed according to generally accepted methods.</li>
                            <li>Affiliate Network Campaigns. For all Affiliate's that maintain their own affiliate networks, Affiliate agrees to place the Links in its affiliate network (the "Network") for access and use by those affiliates in Affiliate's Network (each a "Third Party Affiliate"). Affiliate agrees that it will expressly forbid any Third Party Affiliate to modify the Links in any way. Affiliate agrees to maintain its Network according to the highest industry standards. Affiliate shall not permit any party to be a Third Party Affiliate whose web site or business model involves content containing Objectionable Content. All Third Party Affiliates must be in good standing with Affiliate. Affiliate must require and confirm that all Third Party Affiliates affirmatively accept, through verifiable means, this Agreement prior to obtaining access to the Links. Affiliate shall promptly terminate any Third Party Affiliate who takes, or could reasonably be expected to take, any action that violates the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event that either party suspects any wrongdoing by a Third Party Affiliate with respect to the Links, Affiliate shall promptly disclose to MGine Digital LLC the identity and contact information for such Third Party Affiliate. Affiliate shall promptly remove any Third Party Affiliate from the Affiliate Program and terminate their access to future Offers of MGine Digital LLC in the Network upon written notice from MGine Digital LLC. Unless MGine Digital LLC has been provided with all truthful and complete contact information for a Third Party Affiliate and such Third Party Affiliate has affirmatively accepted this Agreement as recorded by MGine Digital LLC, Affiliate shall remain liable for all acts or omissions of any Third Party Affiliate.</li>

                        <p>Affiliate shall be responsible for the payment of all attorneys fees and expenses incurred by MGine Digital LLC to enforce the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between MGine Digital LLC and Affiliate with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and/or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral.

Affiliate may not assign all or any part of this Agreement without MGine Digital LLC prior written consent. MGine Digital LLC may assign this Agreement at any time with notice to Affiliate.

                <h2>Data Protection Addendum</h2>

                <p>Effective Date of Data Protection May 25, 2018</p>

                <p>We refer to the affiliate Terms located at <a href="/publisher-terms-and-conditions.html" target="_blank">“Agreement”</a> which You have accepted to avail Mgine Digital LLC’s advertising services as a affiliate (referred as “You” or “affiliate”).</p>

                <p>Until 25 May 2018, the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “DPA”) is the key piece of legislation governing data protection. The General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), is a new piece of legislation which will largely supersede the DPA on 25 May 2018. The GDPR will then apply to the processing that is carried out under the Agreement for any Personal Data related to Data Subjects in the European Union (“EU”).</p>

                <p>The GDPR requires data processing contracts – such as the Agreement – to contain additional provisions regulating the processing Personal Data of Data Subjects based on EU. Therefore, the parties agree to add the data protection Segment, set out below to the Agreement with effect from 25 May 2018 (the “Variation Date”). These terms of the data protection Segment shall be deemed to be incorporated within the Agreement.</p>

                <p>This data protection Segment makes reference to the “Model Contract Clauses”, produced by the European Commission, which are incorporated into this data protection Segment as if they had been set out in full.
