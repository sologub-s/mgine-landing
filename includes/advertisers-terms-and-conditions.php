                        <li>will not transfer, export, display, forward or otherwise share information contained in the Unaccepted Action Data to/with any third party;</li>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Advertiser can show that any such Publishers and Affiliates already provided such services to Advertiser prior to the date of the first IO executed by the parties, then Advertiser shall not be prohibited from continuing such relationship. Advertiser agrees that monetary damages for its breach, or threatened breach, of this Section 14 will not be adequate and that MGine Digital LLC shall be entitled to:</li>
                        <li>injunctive relief (including temporary and preliminary relief) without the requirement to post a bond;.</li>

                    <p>Other than with respect to payment obligations arising hereunder, neither party will be liable, or be considered to be in breach of this Agreement, on account of such party's delay or failure to perform as required under the terms of this Agreement as a result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such party's reasonable control and that such party is unable to overcome through the exercise of commercially reasonable diligence (a "Force Majeure Event"). If any such Force Majeure Event occurs including, without limitation, acts of God, fires, explosions, telecommunications, Internet or Affiliate Network failure, results of vandalism or computer hacking, storm or other natural occurrences, national emergencies, acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, wars, strikes or other labor difficulties, or any act or omission of any other person or entity, the affected party will give the other party notice and will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact of any such event.</p>

                    <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Assignment. Neither party may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under the Agreement or any IO without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempts to do so shall be null and void; provided, however, that either party may assign the Agreement, any IO or any portion hereof/thereof, to:</li>
                        <li>an acquirer of all or substantially all of such party's equity, business or assets;</li>
                        <li>a successor in interest whether by merger, reorganization or otherwise; or</li>
                        <li>any entity controlling or under common control with such party.</li>
                        <li>Choice of Law/Venue. The Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York. In the event that any suit, action or other legal proceeding shall be instituted against either party in connection with the Agreement, each hereby submits to the jurisdiction of either the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court of competent jurisdiction, located in New York County, and further agrees to comply with all the requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction.</li>
                        <li>Modification. The Agreement, any exhibits attached hereto and any and all applicable IO(s) represent the complete and entire expression of the agreement between the parties, and shall supersede any and all other agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties. The Agreement, any exhibits attached hereto and any and all applicable IO(s) may be amended only by a written agreement executed by an authorized representative of each party. To the extent that anything in or associated with any IO is in conflict or inconsistent with the Agreement, the IO shall take precedence.</li>
                        <li>Non-Waiver/Severability. No waiver of any breach of any provision of the Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. If any provision contained in the Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, then such provision will be severed and replaced with a new provision that most closely reflects the real intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</li>
                        <li>Relationship of the Parties. The parties hereto are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, agency, employment, franchise or joint venture between the parties. Neither party has the authority to bind the other, or incur any obligation on its behalf; provided, however, that MGine Digital LLC acts as a limited agent of Advertiser for the sole purpose of performing the Services set forth in applicable IO(s).</li>

                <h2>Data Protection Addendum</h2>

                <p>Effective Date of Data Protection May 25, 2018</p>

                <p>We refer to the advertiser’s Terms located at <a href="/advertisers-terms-and-conditions.html" target="_blank">“Agreement”</a> which You have accepted to avail Mgine Digital LLC’s advertising services as a affiliate (referred as “You” or “Advertiser”).</p>

                <p>Until 25 May 2018, the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “DPA”) is the key piece of legislation governing data protection. The General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), is a new piece of legislation which will largely supersede the DPA on 25 May 2018. The GDPR will then apply to the processing that is carried out under the Agreement for any Personal Data related to Data Subjects in the European Union (“EU”).</p>

                <p>The GDPR requires data processing contracts – such as the Agreement – to contain additional provisions regulating the processing Personal Data of Data Subjects based on EU. Therefore, the parties agree to add the data protection Segment, set out below to the Agreement with effect from 25 May 2018 (the “Variation Date”). These terms of the data protection Segment shall be deemed to be incorporated within the Agreement.</p>

                <p>This data protection Segment makes reference to the “Model Contract Clauses”, produced by the European Commission, which are incorporated into this data protection Segment as if they had been set out in full. The full legal name for the Model Contract Clauses is: “The EU-controller to Non-EU/EEA processor model contractual clauses annexed to European Commission Decision C(2010)”.</p>

                <h3>GENERAL TERMS</h3>

                <p>Except as set out in this data protection Segment, the Agreement and any other agreements already in place between us shall continue in full force and effect; In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this data protection Segment and the terms and conditions of the Agreement, this data protection Segment shall prevail; and To the extent that this data protection Segment does not address project-specific data mechanics or specific details relevant to data processing already set out in the Agreement (such as a particular type or frequency of data transfer), those project specific mechanics will remain in place, save that they shall be interpreted to give full effect to the provisions of this data protection Segment and the GDPR.</p>

                <p>This data protection Segment (including the Model Contract Clauses, particularly at clauses 9 and 11.3) and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (a “Claim”) shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the law of England and Wales. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any Claim.</p>

                <p>Please accept or sign and return the data protection Segment to acknowledge your agreement of these terms.</p>

                <p>If you do not accept these terms, we will discontinue any EU user related transactions with your applications/mobile websites. Additionally, please do not share any EU user data with us. However, if you continue to use our services, you will be deemed to have accepted these terms.</p>
